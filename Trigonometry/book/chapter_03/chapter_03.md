# Chapter 3 - Sine and Cosine

Chapter 2 covered the Pythagorean theorem, which is a relationship between the three sides of a right triangle. Other than the fact that one angle was 90 degrees, there's not much about angles in there. As long as you have that right angle, the relationship of the sides holds true, no matter what the other angles are.

But now let's go into some more complex relationships. These are the relationships between a single angle of a right triangle and the ratio of two sides of its sides.

Remember back in chapter 1, I showed that when one angle of a triangle increases or decreases (and the adjacent sides remain the same length), the opposite side increases or decreases in proportion. With right triangles, there is a similar relationship, but a bit more complex and much more useful.

Of course, you can't have both adjacent sides keep their lengths, because that would break the right angle. But you can say that one of the sides, usually the hypotenuse, will stay the same.

Figure 3.1 shows what happens when this occurs in a right triangle.

*Figure 3-1. Changing an angle in a right triangle.*

You can see that as angle A changes, and side c (the hypotenuse) stays the same length, side a (the opposite side) gets larger, and side b (the adjacent side) gets smaller.

Now you can consider three ratios in relationship to this angle. 

1. The ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.
2. The ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.
3. The ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.

The important thing to realize is that it doesn't matter what the measurements of the sides are. For any given angle, those ratios will *always* be the same.

These three ratios are the most important thing you need to learn and memorize about trigonomotry. They are at the core of everything else you'll see in this book. They are so important, they have special names: sine, cosine and tangent.

- sine = opposite / hypotenuse (SOH)
- cosine = adjacent / hypotenuse (CAH)
- tangent = opposite / adjacent (TOA)

If you took trigonometry in school, you were probably taught "SOH, CAH, TOA" as a way to remember these three ratios. As mnemonics go, it's one of the one's that's stuck around pretty well.

When I say "ratio", I mean you can just divide the two values. For the sine of an angle, divide the length of the opposite side by the length of the hypotenuse. The fascinating and useful thing about this is that it doesn't matter what size the triangle is. For any given angle, those ratios will be exactly the same.

Take figure 3-2 for example. Angle A in the first triangle is 30 degrees. Its opposite side has a length of 3 and the hypotenuse measures 5. Thus, the sine of 30 degrees is 3 / 5, or 0.6. The second triangle is twice as big, but angle A is still 30 degrees. The opposite side is 6 and the hypotenuse is 10. So the sine of angle A is now 6 / 10, which is still 0.6.

*Figure 3-2. Same angle, same ratio.*

So these values hold true for any angle. When I was a kid, our math books had pages of charts in the back. For each angle, in maybe 1/10th of a degree intervals, it would give you the sine, cosine, tangent, and maybe some other values for that angle. Of course, now even cheap calculators have these functions built in, and provide a much higher degree of accuracy. You could just type in 30 and press the sine button and it should output 0.5.

You can also figure out the cosine of 30 degrees.
