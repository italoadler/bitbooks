# Chapter 7 - Law of Sines and Law of Cosines

Throughout the past four chapters, we've dealt exclusively with techniques that required right triangles - triangles where one of the angles is ninety degrees. And, as you've seen, there are a lot of useful techniques you can employ when you can model your problem with such triangles. But sometimes you wind up needing to calculate some of the sides or angles of a triangle that is NOT a right triangle.

So is trigonometry useless in those cases? Of course not, but it does require some additional techniques. In this chapter we'll look at two laws that will help us find all the measurements of any triangle, provided we have a minimal amount of information to start with.
